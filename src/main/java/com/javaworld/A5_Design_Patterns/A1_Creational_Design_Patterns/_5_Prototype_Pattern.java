 * 
 *         Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly
 *         affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a
 *         similar object already existing.
 * 
 *         Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to
 *         a new object and then modify it according to our needs. Prototype
 *         design pattern uses java cloning to copy the object.
 * 
 *         Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database. Now we need
 *         to modify this data in our program multiple times, so itï¿½s not a good
 *         idea to create the Object using new keyword and load all the data
 *         again from database.
 * 
 *         The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new
 *         object and then do the data manipulation.
 * 
 *         Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are
 *         copying should provide the copying feature. It should not be done by
 *         any other class. However, whether to use shallow or deep copy of the
 *         Object properties depends on the requirements and it`s a design
 *         decision.
 * 
 *         If the object cloning was not provided, we will have to make database
 *         call to fetch the employee list every time. Then do the manipulations
 *         that would have been resource and time-consuming.
