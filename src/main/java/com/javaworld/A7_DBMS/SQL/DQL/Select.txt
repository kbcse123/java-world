DQL stands for Data Query Language


1) SELECT Column(s) - The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name;

Example:
    SELECT CustomerName, City
    FROM Customers;

2) SELECT all columns - to display all columns data

Syntax:
    SELECT *
    FROM table_name;

Example:
    SELECT *
    FROM Customers;

3) SELECT DISTINCT - This statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Syntax:
    SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name;

Example:
    SELECT DISTINCT Country
    FROM Customers;

    a) Count Distinct -
    By using the DISTINCT keyword in a function called COUNT, we can return the count of different
    countries.

    Example:
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

4) SELECT with WHERE - is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

    Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;

    a) Text Fields v/s Numeric Fields
       SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems allows double quotes too).
       However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes.

        Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country='Mexico';

        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE CustomerID=1;
    b) Operators in The WHERE Clause

        Example: Select all customers with a CustomerID greater than 80:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE CustomerID > 80;

    The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:

    Operator	  Description
        =	        Equal
        >	        Greater than
        <	        Less than
        >=	        Greater than or equal
        <=	        Less than or equal
        <>	        Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
        BETWEEN	    Between a certain range
        LIKE	    Search for a pattern
        IN	        To specify multiple possible values for a column

5) SELECT TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause
    These clauses are used to specify the number of records to return.

    Example: Select only the first 10 records of the Customers table:
        SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Customers;

    Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to
    select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.

    SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:
        SELECT TOP number column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;

    MySQL Syntax:
        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition
        LIMIT number;

    Oracle 12 Syntax:
        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        ORDER BY column_name(s)
        FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;

    Older Oracle Syntax:
        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE ROWNUM <= number;

6) SQL TOP PERCENT -
    The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table.

    SQL Server:
        SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT *
        FROM Customers;

    Oracle:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;
