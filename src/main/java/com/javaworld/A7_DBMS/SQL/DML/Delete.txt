1) DELETE
    This statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

    Syntax:
    DELETE FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;

    Example:
    DELETE FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerName='Shaik';

2) Delete All Records - delete all rows in a table without deleting the table

To delete the table completely, use the DROP TABLE statement
