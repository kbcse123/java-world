Aggregate Functions
    An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single
    value.

1) MIN() and MAX()
    returns the smallest/largest value of the selected column.

    Syntax:
        SELECT MIN(column_name)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;

        SELECT MAX(column_name)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;

    When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will not have a descriptive name. use the AS keyword:
        Example:
            SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
            FROM Products;

2) COUNT()
    .This Function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.

    Syntax:
        SELECT COUNT(column_name)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;

    Example:
        Find the total number of rows in the Products table:
            SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM Products;

    .If you specify a column name instead of (*), NULL values will not be counted.
        Find the number of products where the ProductName is not null:
            SELECT COUNT(ProductName)
            FROM Products;

        Find the number of products where Price is higher than 20:
            SELECT COUNT(ProductID)
            FROM Products
            WHERE Price > 20;

    .You can ignore duplicates by using the DISTINCT keyword in the COUNT() function.
        How many different prices are there in the Products table:
            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Price)
            FROM Products;

    .Give the counted column a alias name by using the AS keyword.
            SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalRecords
            FROM Products;

            SELECT COUNT(*) AS [Number of records]
            FROM Products;

3) SUM() - This function returns the total sum of a numeric column.

        Syntax:
            SELECT SUM(column_name)
            FROM table_name
            WHERE condition;
