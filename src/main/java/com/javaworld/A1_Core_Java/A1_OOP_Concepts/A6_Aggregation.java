/**
 * Aggregation and Composition are very closely related terms. In aggregation child can exist independently 
 * without the parent where as in composition a child cannot exist without parent, Child is completely controlled by 
 * parent.
 * 
 * For example: Library and book, Can a book exist without library? Yes, it can; I have got only one book in my hand,
 * it is possible. That is, delete the library, still book can exist, It is an aggregation. But a library cannot
 * exist without books. So here, you should consider the direction also, From book to library it is aggregation but
 * from library to book it is composition, dependency matters.
 * 
 * Therefore Composition is a STRONGER relationship whereas Aggregation is a WEAKER relationship.
 * 
 * Note: Aggregation and Composition are not OOPs concepts.
