An I/O Stream represents an input source or an output destination. A stream can represent many different kinds of sources and destinations,
including disk files, devices, other programs, and memory arrays. Streams support many different kinds of data, including
simple bytes, primitive data types, localized characters, and objects. Some streams simply pass on data;
others manipulate and transform the data in useful ways.

A stream is a sequence of data.
. A program uses an input stream to read data from a source, one item at a time.
. A program uses an output stream to write data to a destination, one item at time.
