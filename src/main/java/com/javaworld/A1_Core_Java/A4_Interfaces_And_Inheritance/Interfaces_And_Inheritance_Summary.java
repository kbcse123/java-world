/**
 * Interfaces:
 *  . Generally speaking, interfaces are contracts that shows how the software interacts.
 *  . An interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default
 *    methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods.
 *  . Interfaces cannot be instantiated,they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
 *    A class can implement more than one interface, so the implements keyword is followed by a comma-separated list of
 *    the interfaces implemented by the class.
 *  . All abstract, default, and static methods in an interface are implicitly public, so you can omit the public modifier.
 * 	. Similarly, all constant values defined in an interface are implicitly public, static, and final. Once again, you
 * 	  can omit these modifiers.
