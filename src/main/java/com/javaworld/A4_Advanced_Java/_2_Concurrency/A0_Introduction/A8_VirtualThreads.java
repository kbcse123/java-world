/**
 * virtual threads (JEP-425) are JVM-managed lightweight threads that help in writing high-throughput
 * concurrent applications (throughput means how many units of information a system can process in a
 * given amount of time).
 *
 * In contrast to platform threads, the virtual threads are not wrappers of OS threads. They are
 * lightweight Java entities (with their own stack memory with a small footprint â€“ only a few hundred
 * bytes) that are cheap to create, block, and destroy. We can create many of them at the same time
 * (millions) so they sustain a massive throughput.
 *
 * Virtual threads are stored in the JVM heap (and they take advantage of Garbage Collector) instead
 * of the OS stack. Moreover, virtual threads are scheduled by the JVM via a work-stealing
 * ForkJoinPool scheduler. Practically, JVM schedules and orchestrates virtual threads to run on
 * platform threads in such a way that a platform thread executes only one virtual thread at a time.
