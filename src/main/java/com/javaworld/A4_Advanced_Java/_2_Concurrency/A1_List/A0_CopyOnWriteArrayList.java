 * 
 *         A thread-safe variant of ArrayList in which all mutative operations
 *         (add, set, and so on) are implemented by making a fresh copy of the
 *         underlying array.
 * 
 *         This is ordinarily too costly, but may be more efficient than
 *         alternatives when traversal operations vastly outnumber mutations,
 *         and is useful when you cannot or don't want to synchronize
 *         traversals, yet need to preclude interference among concurrent
 *         threads. The "snapshot" style iterator method uses a reference to the
 *         state of the array at the point that the iterator was created. This
 *         array never changes during the lifetime of the iterator, so
 *         interference is impossible and the iterator is guaranteed not to
 *         throw ConcurrentModificationException. The iterator will not reflect
 *         additions, removals, or changes to the list since the iterator was
 *         created. Element-changing operations on iterators themselves (remove,
 *         set, and add) are not supported. These methods throw
 *         UnsupportedOperationException.
 * 
 *         All elements are permitted, including null.
 * 
 *         Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections,
 *         actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a
 *         CopyOnWriteArrayList happen-before actions subsequent to the access
 *         or removal of that element from the CopyOnWriteArrayList in another
 *         thread.
