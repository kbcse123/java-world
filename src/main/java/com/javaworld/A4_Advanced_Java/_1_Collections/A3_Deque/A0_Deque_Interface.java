 * 
 *         A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at
 *         both ends. The name deque is short for "double ended queue" and is
 *         usually pronounced "deck". Most Deque implementations place no fixed
 *         limits on the number of elements they may contain, but this interface
 *         supports capacity-restricted deques as well as those with no fixed
 *         size limit.
 * 
 *         This interface defines methods to access the elements at both ends of
 *         the deque. Methods are provided to insert, remove, and examine the
 *         element. Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws an
 *         exception if the operation fails, the other returns a special value
 *         (either null or false, depending on the operation). The latter form
 *         of the insert operation is designed specifically for use with
 *         capacity-restricted Deque implementations; in most implementations,
 *         insert operations cannot fail.
 * 
 *         This interface extends the Queue interface. When a deque is used as a
 *         queue, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior results. Elements are added
 *         at the end of the deque and removed from the beginning.
 * 
 *         Note that the peek method works equally well when a deque is used as
 *         a queue or a stack; in either case, elements are drawn from the
 *         beginning of the deque.
 * 
 *         This interface provides two methods to remove interior elements,
 *         removeFirstOccurrence and removeLastOccurrence.
 * 
 *         Unlike the List interface, this interface does not provide support
 *         for indexed access to elements.
 * 
 *         While Deque implementations are not strictly required to prohibit the
 *         insertion of null elements, they are strongly encouraged to do so.
 *         Users of any Deque implementations that do allow null elements are
 *         strongly encouraged not to take advantage of the ability to insert
 *         nulls. This is so because null is used as a special return value by
 *         various methods to indicated that the deque is empty.
 * 
 *         Deque implementations generally do not define element-based versions
 *         of the equals and hashCode methods, but instead inherit the
 *         identity-based versions from class Object.
 *
