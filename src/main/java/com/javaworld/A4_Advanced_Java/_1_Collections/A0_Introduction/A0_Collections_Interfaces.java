 *         . The core collection interfaces encapsulate different types of
 *         collections. These interfaces allow collections to be manipulated
 *         independently of the details of their representation. Core collection
 *         interfaces are the foundation of the Java Collections Framework.
 * 
 *         . A Set is a special kind of Collection, a SortedSet is a special
 *         kind of Set, and so forth. Note that the hierarchy consists of two
 *         distinct trees ï¿½ a Map is not a true Collection.
 * 
 *         . Also note that all the core collection interfaces are generic. For
 *         example, this is the declaration of the Collection interface: public
 *         interface Collection<E>...
 * 
 * 
 *         . The <E> syntax tells you that the interface is generic. When you
 *         declare a Collection instance you can and should specify the type of
 *         object contained in the collection. Specifying the type allows the
 *         compiler to verify (at compile-time) that the type of object you put
 *         into the collection is correct, thus reducing errors at runtime.
 * 
 * 
 *         . The core collection interfaces are shown in the picture
 *         "core_collection_interfaces.png", And are described in later
 *         sections.
