/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * How to develop a UI page/screen which can displays data from multiple services.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Each UI team can develop a client side UI component such as Angular Component which implements or corresponds to a
 * particular microservice. For multiple services, UI team is responsible to prepare a skeleton UI or page skeletons by
 * building pages which are composed of multiple service specific UI components.
 *
 * Advantages:
 *  .Independent UI Teams − Each UI team can work once a microservice contract is available without any need for all
 *   microServices availability.
 *  .Manageable UI development − UI being developed in components becomes manageable and efficient.
 *  .Easier Development − UI development becomes easier and maintainable.
