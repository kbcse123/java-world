/**
 * Managing a microservices architecture involves a variety of complex challenges that are seldom encountered in
 * traditional monolithic systems. These challenges include:
 *
 * Service orchestration: Ensuring that multiple, independent services communicate seamlessly to execute complex
 * business processes.
 *
 * Fault tolerance: In a distributed system, a failure in one service shouldnâ€™t lead to a system-wide collapse.
 *
 * Data consistency: Unlike monolithic systems where you can rely on ACID transactions in a single database,
 * microservices often have their own databases, making transactional consistency a big concern.
 *
 * Service discoverability: How services locate each other in a dynamically scaling environment.
 *
 * To address these challenges systematically, developers can leverage microservices design patterns.
 * These are tested solutions that serve as templates for solving recurring design problems.
